The ACCESS Credit Equivalent is a measure of how much compute time was used on each resource.
One ACCESS Credit Equivalent is defined as one CPU Hour on SDSC Expanse (an AMD EPYC 7742 based compute resource).
The ACCESS Credit Equivalent allows comparison between usage of node-allocated, core-allocated and GPU-allocated 
resources. It also allows a comparison between resources with different compute power per core.

avg_nu,NUs Charged: Per Job,"The average amount of NUs charged per ACCESS job.<br/>
<i>NU - Normalized Units: </i>Roaming allocations are awarded in XSEDE Service Units (SUs). 1 XSEDE SU is defined as one CPU-hour on a Phase-1 DTF cluster. 
For usage on a resource that is charged to a Roaming allocation, a normalization factor is applied. The normalization factor is based on
the method historically used to calculate 'Normalized Units' (Cray X-MP-equivalent SUs), which derives from a resource's performance on the HPL
benchmark.<br/>

Specifically, 1 Phase-1 DTF SU = 21.576 NUs, and the XD SU conversion factor for a resource is calculated by taking its NU conversion factor
and dividing it by 21.576. The standard formula for calculating a resource's NU conversion factor is: (Rmax * 1000 / 191) / P
where Rmax is the resource's Rmax result on the HPL benchmark in Gflops and P is the number of processors used in the benchmark.
In the absence of an HPL benchmark run, a conversion factor can be agreed upon, based on that of an architecturally similar platform
and scaled according to processor performance differences.<br/>

Conversion to Roaming SUs is handled by the XSEDE central accounting system, and RPs are only required to report usage in local SUs for all allocations.<br/>

Defining an SU charge for specialized compute resources (such as visualization hardware) or non-compute resources (such as storage) is possible, but there is no XSEDE-wide policy for doing so."
